# Meeting 25.01.2024

present Ilpo, Valtteri and Timo

## Project ideas

1. Deep fake detection from video sequence
    - Possibly also audio?
    - Deepfake detection where most of the frames are real but some are fake!

2. Operational Transformer
    - Switch normal neurons to operational neurons in a transformer. Some, all, whatever?
    - NLP task

3. Predicting the electricity price
   - Use ONNs for this
   - Try to find a mix of features to use to predict the data
   - Combining multiple datasets (on time axis)
